    "##  Some rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you have to justify your choice.\n",
    "2. Make sure you use the `data` folder provided in the repository in **read-only** mode.\n",
    "3. Be sure to provide a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "4. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation (in either comments or markdown).\n",
    "5. Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "6. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the master branch. If there are multiple notebooks present, we will not grade anything.\n",
    "7. Also, be sure to hand in a fully-run and evaluated notebook. We will not run your notebook for you, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "8. Make sure to print results or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",

    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The coronavirus pandemic has led to the implementation of unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions ranging from case isolation to national lockdowns. These interventions, along with the disease itself, have created massive shifts in people’s lives. For instance, in mid-May 2020, more than one third of the global population was under lockdown, and millions have since lost their jobs or have moved to work-from-home arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the disease has shifted people's [needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper), [interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok), and [concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Switzerland) across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will take a deep dive into Wikipedia data and try to uncover what changed with the pandemic. More specifically, we will be focusing on Wikipedia pageviews, that is, how many people read each article on Wikipedia each day.\n",
    "A nice graphical user interface for playing with Wikipedia pageviews is available [here](https://pageviews.toolforge.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&redirects=0&range=latest-20&pages=Cat|Dog).\n",
    "Also, the Wikimedia Foundation releases dump files with the number of pageviews per article across all Wikimedia websites, including Wikipedia in all its language editions [(amazing, right?)](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pagecounts-ez/). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### But wait, what is a pageview?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A pageview or page view, abbreviated in business to PV and occasionally called page impression, is a request to load a single HTML file (web page) of an Internet site. On the World Wide Web, a page request would result from a web surfer clicking on a link on another page pointing to the page in question. (Source: [Wikipedia article \"Pageviews\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pageview))\n",
    "\n",
    "Pageviews in Wikipedia can tell us that people are looking for certain information online. Analyzing how the volume and the distribution of pageviews changed can tell us about how the behavior of Wikipedia readers has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will take a deep dive into analyzing Wikipedia pageview logs and uncover shifts in interests associated with the current pandemic.\n",

    "This is a tab-separated file containing daily pageviews for a subset of the articles from Italian Wikipedia. It is compressed! Each row corresponds to a different article, and each column (except the first) corresponds to the number of pageviews this article received on a given day.

    "This is a classification of which topics an article belongs to, according to a model released by the Wikimedia Foundation (the classes are derived from this [taxonomy](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES/Articletopic)). Importantly, this file was obtained from English Wikipedia, while the previous one contains articles from the Italian Wikipedia. This is important because article titles in the Italian Wikipedia are in Italian, while article titles in the English page are in English (duh!). In any case, each line contains a .json object with\n",

    "1. the English name of the article (`name`);\n",

You will often find that reading compressed data on the fly (uncompressing it as you go), is much faster than reading compressed data, since reading and writing to the disk may be your [bottleneck](https://skipperkongen.dk/2012/02/28/uncompressed-versus-compressed-read/). \n",
